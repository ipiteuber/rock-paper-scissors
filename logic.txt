        Define random <- number random between 1 and 100
        number random between 1 and 100 = ((Math.random() * 100) + 1)

        u_choice = u_choice.toLowerCase()
        u_choice = u_choice.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + u_choice.slice(1)

Make comparison of the choices
    If CP == rock and U == scissors
        cp wins
    Else if CP == rock and U == rock
        draw
    else if CP == paper and U == rock
        cp wins
    else if CP == paper and U == paper
        draw
    else if CP == scissors and U == paper
        cp wins
    else if CP == scissors and U == scissors
